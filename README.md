### Installation Steps:

To set up the backend, first make sure that Python and Pip are installed. Then run the following the commands in your terminal:

```
$ cd api
$ python3 -m venv venv          # creates virtual environment
$ source ./venv/bin/activate    # activate virtual environment
(venv)$ pip3 install -r ../requirements.txt         # installs requirements
(venv)$ flask run â€”no-debugger  # starts the backend
```

To set up the frontend, first make sure that Node and NPM are installed. Then run the following commands:

```
$ cd frontend
$ npm install
```

### Development Steps:

How to run our app as a two-server process which makes frontend development much nicer.

```bash
# run the backend
cd api
venv/bin/flask run --no-debugger

# *in a separate terminal* run the frontend
cd frontend
npm start
```

How to simulate the production environment as a one-server app.

```bash
# ---build the frontend---
cd frontend
npm run build # build frontend

# ---run the server---
cd api
venv/bin/gunicorn app:app
```

Visit http://localhost:8000 in the browser.

How to activate venv:

```bash
cd api
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Deployment Steps:

Build the frontend first, then push to main branch

```bash
# ---build the frontend---
cd frontend
npm run build # build frontend
```
