            <h3>Celica</h3>
            <h4>Featured in Gaiden and Echoes.</h4>
            <p>
              In Gaiden, Celica gets three more lines than Alm, but both
              characters have less than 25 lines each in the whole game due to
              constraints in the game’s script so it’s difficult to conclusively
              determine her relative importance based on this statistic. In
              contrast, Alm receives over 150 more spoken lines than Celica in
              the remake, Echoes. So even if Celica is technically featured more
              in Gaiden’s story, Alm clearly wins out as the top-billed lord in
              the modern version of the story.
            </p>
            <p>
              In both game covers, Alm is also displayed more prominently than
              Celica. In Gaiden, Alm is placed in the center of the artwork
              facing directly, forwards, where Celica is partially hidden and to
              the side of Alm. Her pose is actually mirrored by another
              character, Valbar, who is only available on her route and has no
              plot relevance whatsoever! Celica does receive a bigger feature in
              the Echoes artwork, as she is placed back-to-back with Alm, but
              she still takes up less over the cover space and is placed more
              off-center.

            <h3>Lyn</h3>
            <h4>Featured in The Blazing Blade.</h4>
            <p>
              Line-count wise, Lyn only has one more line than another lord,
              Hector, and both are over 40 lines behind their fellow lord
              Eliwood. While Lyn does lead the first section of the game, known
              as Lyn Mode, her story is set before the rest of the main
              narrative events and effectively functions as a tutorial for the
              player, while she is sidelined in the main story’s narrative and
              only appears to offer opinions to her fellow lords. Similarly to
              Celica in Gaiden, Lyn’s portrait in the game’s cover art is
              partially covered by Eliwood’s.

              Eirika receives over 100 more lines in her own game than her twin
              brother, Ephraim, and is the inciting player in the first third of
              the story’s narrative. While she and Ephraim are featured equally
              on the game’s cover, Eirika’s prominence in the story and the
              accessibility of her route compared to Ephraim’s would categorize
              her as the top-billed lord using these metrics.

            <p>
              Micaiah is introduced as the main lord of Radiant Dawn, the second
              game in the Tellius duology. While she and Ike, the main lord of
              FE9, are prominently featured throughout the game’s story, Micaiah
              receives 90 more spoken lines, is the first character introduced
              to the character, and effectively initiates the inciting incident
              of the whole story. Additionally, she is the most prominently
              featured character on the game’s cover, placed in the center
              without being obscured, while Ike is not featured at all.

            <h3>Lucina</h3>
            <h4>Featured in Awakening.</h4>
            <p>
              Lucina is one of three featured lords in Awakening, the other two
              being her father, Chrom, and the avatar, Robin. She receives
              significantly less lines than the other two, having only a fifth
              of the total number of lines belonging to Chrom. However, she does
              receive a heavy spotlight in the promotational material of the
              game, being featured on the Awakening game poster at equal
              prominence with her father and being the cover of the soundtrack
              album. Subsequent iterations on Awakening heavily feature her as
              the main lord as well (notably her inclusion in Super Smash Bros
              and Fire Emblem: Engage). That being said, in her own game, she is
              nowhere near being the top billed lord.

            <h3>Edelgard</h3>
            <h4>Featured in Three Houses.</h4>
            <p>
              Three Houses has a unique narrative structure: the player follows
              the story of Byleth, the main avatar character, who chooses one of
              three lords to follow. Edelgard is the only female option of the
              three lords, and while she plays a massive role in the game’s
              narrative, inciting the events in the second half of the game, she
              is actually still shafted by the writers. Edelgard has the least
              amount of lines of all four lords in Three Houses, and her
              personal route is 3-4 chapters shorter than every other route in
              the game while also not featuring a unique final battle theme;
              additionally, she is the only lord who the players are given the
              option to abandon even after initially choosing her route. In
              promotional material, however, she is displayed with equal
              prominence to the rest of the lords.

          So there are two definitively top-billed female lords in the series,
          out of the seven available: Micaiah from{" "}
          <Description tag="FE10">Radiant Dawn</Description> and Eirika from{" "}
          <Description tag="FE8">Sacred Stones</Description>. When looking at
          in-game content, all other female lords are arguably less prominent or
          neglected in their game compared to other male lords. However, several
          more female lords have been favored in promotional and post-game
          content: Lyn from <Description tag="FE7">Blazing Blade</Description>{" "}
          and Lucina from <Description tag="FE13">Awakening</Description> have
          become the faces of their games in most featured content and have
          retroactively become the most popular lords in their games, while
          Edelgard from <Description tag="FE16">Three Houses</Description> is
          one of the most recognizable characters in the series and widely
          discussed when examining the game’s narrative content.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, the inclusion of the{" "}
          <Description tag="avatar">avatar</Description> has significantly
          improved the series’ female representation: every mainline game in the
          series following the inclusion of the first avatar in{" "}
          <Description tag="FE12">New Mystery</Description> has had the option
          to follow a female lord. Additionally, if we don’t consider remakes,
          every single game in the franchise since{" "}
          <Description tag="FE7">Blazing Blade</Description> has featured a
          female or optionally female lord with the exception of{" "}
          <Description tag="FE9">Path of Radiance.</Description> However,{" "}
          <i>Path of Radiance’s</i> sequel,{" "}
          <Description tag="FE10">Radiant Dawn</Description>, prominently
          features Micaiah as the main lord, so every “narrative” of the
          franchise since has had a representative female lord.{" "}
