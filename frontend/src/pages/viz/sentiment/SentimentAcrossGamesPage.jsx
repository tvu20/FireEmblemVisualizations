          How does sentiment change over the course of a game? Are there
          similarities in the most positive or negative points in each game?
          Each small multiple represents the sentiment trajectory of a game as
          tracked by the number of positive lines compared with the number of
          negative lines. A negative value means a lower overall sentiment and
          vice versa. There is also a combined graph with the average curve of
          all the sentiments - we can see that there arenâ€™t particularly
          significant overarching trends other than every game skews very
          negative, which makes sense in a series of games about wars!
