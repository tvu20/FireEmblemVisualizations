          In addition to traditional polarity sentiment analysis, I wanted to
          study how an emotion classification model could be trained to label
          data from a particular medium or genre. I trained a BERT model to
          label dialogue lines with one of{" "}

          </a>{" "}
          or with the neutral label, achieving 75% accuracy. The resulting
          predictor was used to label each dialogue line across the series.

          This steamgraph represents the distribution of emotions across
          dialogue lines throughout the main story of a game, with story
          progression being represented by the horizontal axis of the graph.
          Select a game from the dropdown to view its emotional journey. Each of
          the five emotion labels is color-coded, with the neutral tag being
          represented as gray.
